					<div class="content">
						<h2 class="major">Our Mission</h2>
						<p>To use blockchain technology to safely and securely store patient medical data that is completely in control of the patient, as well as provide the means to easily give access to the records between various healthcare providers. The current healthcare system makes transfer of healthcare information difficult, failing to fulfill the needs of patients switching insurance systems or healthcare providers. To bridge this gap, we propose Resilient Records, to allow dynamic transfer of medical data.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Our Work</h2>
						<p>Our focus was researching different avenues to enable the user to dynamically and securely give access to files or data to multiple users in a public blockchain network; and to integrate such mechanisms within ResilientDB.</p>

						<h2 class="major">Use Cases</h2>
						<p>In addition to transfer of medical data from a patient to a hospital, ResilientRecords can help you transfer data in an encrypted format for your use case.</p>
						<p>Potential use cases include managing the amount of data different people have access to, transferring self employed/gig worker history to a customer(eg. Uber drivers use blockchain to control their own history), and sharing location data logs for travel based occupations.</p>

			<section class="wrapper style2">
				<div class="inner">
					<h3 class="major">What is Proxy Re-Encryption?</h3>
					<p>Proxy re-encryption (PRE) allows someone to encrypt data using a public key and then give access to that encrypted data to someone else without ever sharing a user’s personal private key. PRE achieves this by using a proxy as a middleman that performs re-encryption on that encrypted data. Re-encryption is the process of taking a conversion key and using it to swap the encrypted file from being encrypted by one public key to being encrypted by a different public key. </p>
					<p>To elaborate, the owner of the encrypted data takes their personal private key and the public key of the recipient they’re trying to give access to. They take the private and public key and create a conversion key. The importance of the conversion key is that, if it used to encrypt the already encrypted file, it will remove the owner’s existing encryption and convert the file to being encrypted with the public key of the recipient. The process of re-encryption using the conversion key is relevant and necessary because the proxy that is performing the re-encryption is not capable of un-encrypting the original file: encrypting with the conversion key directly converts the encrypted file from the owner’s encryption to the recipient’s encryption. This is important because it means that none of the proxies have to be trusted, as it’s impossible to decrypt the file with the conversion key.</p>

					<h3 class="major">How does Proxy Re-Encryption Fit into Our Model?</h3>
					<p>We are building this system using the ResilientDB architecture which means that we have to fit PRE into the ResilientDB architecture somehow. So, in the scheme of PRE, the proxy will be the ResilientDB nodes/miners. That means that the ResilientDB nodes miners will be responsible for storing the conversion key that is generated when access to an encrypted file is given. Additionally, the ResilientDB nodes/miners will be responsible for the re-encryption of a given file using the conversion key that is stored on the blockchain. The blockchain will be responsible for removing conversion keys when the owner of an encrypted file requests to revoke permission to a recipient.</p>

					<p>Several weeks were spent researching other platforms, networks and cryptographic engines in order to find a solution model that matches our initial implementation model closely; or could be used tangentially with our design plan for ResilientDB for a stronger development project within the scope of ten weeks.</p>

			<!-- FUTURE -->
			<section class="wrapper spotlight style2">
				<div class="inner">
					<div class="content">
						<h2 class="major">Future</h2>
						<p> We want to integrate IPFS to store large amounts of data in file format. We also want to integrate the proxy re-encryption code into ResilientDB. The reason that wasn't achieved is because the proxy re-encryption implementation we created relies on pyUmbral which is written in Python. We really struggled to figure out how to get Python running on the ResilientDB docker containers. If Python was installed on the docker containers, integrating the PRE code we created into ResilientDB would be really easy because we already created the smart contracts that would run the PRE code.</p>
